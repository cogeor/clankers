      1. Add [profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level=2 to root Cargo.toml
         (optimizes nalgebra, clarabel, rapier in debug builds = ~10x speedup)
      2. Pre-allocate solver workspace matrices in MpcSolver::new()
         (eliminates ~772KB allocation per solve call)

    scope: "fix(mpc)"
    description: |
      1. Only set swing_starts at actual liftoff transition (not every stance frame)
         Track previous contact state per leg, detect transition
      2. Blend motor gains over early swing phase (first 10%) to avoid jerk
      3. Both examples + plugin must be updated
